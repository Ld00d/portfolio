<h1>On Second Thought</h1>
<p><em>This is a continuation post in a series of posts about how I made this site you're reading this on.</em></p>
<p>Ok, this is getting a bit unwieldy. What started as a fun project to make a portfolio has ballooned a bit. Markdown is more complicated than I thought. I looked at the original Perl code. I don't know Perl at all, but what it looks like is there are regular expressions it uses to find and replace matches with their HTML counterparts. What I had in mind for this project was more like a parser/compiler. Even if I just stick to the original true Markdown elements, they all have varying ways of being implemented, and require a lot of special handling. I could do this (I think), but not in the time frame I'm trying to stick to. I really want to be done over about 3 weekends, and I'm not feeling like I can if I try to re-invent this particular wheel.</p>
<p>Vue.js has a directive <code>v-html</code> that can be used to output plain old HTML. I can use pretty much any Markdown processor to convert .md files to .html. Looks like <a href="https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it" title="markdown-it">markdown-it</a> is a pretty good tool for conversion. I'll just add a script that can be run by npm to convert the files and produce metadata.</p>
